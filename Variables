# Task 1: Variables

# 1. Create variable named pi and store 22/7; check type
pi = 22/7
print("pi =", pi)
print("type(pi) =", type(pi))   # expected <class 'float'>

# 2. Create a variable called for and assign 4 -> this will fail because 'for' is a Python keyword.
# The following line is invalid and will raise a SyntaxError if uncommented:
# for = 4

# Instead, show correct approach: use for_var
for_var = 4
print("for_var =", for_var)

# Explanation printed:
print("\nExplanation: 'for' is a reserved keyword in Python (used for loops). "
      "You cannot use it as a variable name. Use another name like 'for_var'.")

# 3. Simple Interest calculation
P = 10000   # example principal
R = 5       # annual rate percent
T = 3       # years
simple_interest = (P * R * T) / 100
print(f"\nSimple Interest for P={P}, R={R}%, T={T} years = {simple_interest}")
